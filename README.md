# WEB SCRAPING

Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting data from websites. It involves fetching the HTML code of a web page, parsing it to extract the desired information, and then saving that information in a structured format, such as a database or a spreadsheet.

With features like filtering and Beautiful Soup we are able to find complex patterns and gives us the ease of access to some of the attributes in the HTML.

## BeautifulSoup(bs4)

This is a python library used for web scraping and parsing HTML documents. It provides methods for navigating, searching and modifying parsed documents

It creates a parse tree from the HTML source provided and allows you to extract data effortlessly.

Apart from parsing and ease of access, beautiful soup helps in:

  1. Searching using methods like find, find.all(looks through a tag's descendants and retrieves all descendants that match your filter) making it easy to extract specific data.
  2. It supports different parsers giving you flexibility in choosing the parser based on your requirements
  3. It is designed to handle poorly formatted or invalid HTML, allowing you to extract data even from imperfect documents
